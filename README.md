# maui-service
A Java webservice container for the open source [Maui](https://github.com/zelandiya/maui) project.  Maui automatically identifies topics in text documents.  Depending on the task, topics are tags, keywords, keyphrases, vocabulary terms, descriptors, index terms or titles of Wikipedia articles.

This service depends on the 1.3.1-RELEASE version of maui which must be pulled and built from [Maui Project](https://github.com/zelandiya/maui) prior to building the maui-service.
